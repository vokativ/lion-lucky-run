# Lion Lucky Run - A Lunar New Year Adventure

Welcome to **Lion Lucky Run**! Embark on a vibrant, endless running adventure featuring a traditional Lion Dance costume. This game is designed to celebrate the joy and traditions of the Lunar New Year (Chinese New Year).

## 🏮 About Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year)

For those new to the celebration, **Chinese New Year** (or Lunar New Year) is one of the most important holidays in many Asian cultures. It marks the beginning of the new year on the traditional lunisolar calendar.

Here are some key symbols you'll see in the game:
*   **Lion Dance:** A form of traditional dance where performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume to bring good luck and fortune.
*   **Red Envelopes (Hongbao):** Red packets filled with money, given as gifts to symbolize good wishes and luck for the new year.
*   **Oranges/Tangerines:** Symbols of abundance and good fortune because the word for orange sounds like "gold" or "success" in Chinese.
*   **Fortune/Luck:** A central theme of the holiday. Doing good deeds and following traditions brings "fortune" for the year ahead!

## 🎮 Why is this fun?

*   **Festive Atmosphere:** Run through colorful environments inspired by the holiday, from starry skies to Singapore skylines!
*   **Fast-Paced Action:** The game speeds up as you go! Can you keep up?
*   **"Lucky Burst" Mode:** Collect enough fortune to trigger a rainbow-colored invincibility mode—it's super satisfying to smash through obstacles!
*   **Kid-Friendly:** Simple controls and forgiving mechanics (you don't lose immediately if you hit an obstacle, unless your fortune runs out!) make it great for all ages.

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls

You can play on a computer or a touchscreen device.

**Keyboard:**
*   **Arrow Keys (⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️):** Move the Lion up, down, left, or right.
*   **P or ESC:** Pause the game.
*   **Q:** Quit to the main menu.

**Touchscreen / Mouse:**
*   **Tap/Click & Hold:** The Lion will follow your finger or cursor.
*   **Tap Buttons:** Use the on-screen pause and quit buttons.

### Game Mechanics

1.  **Collect Good Items:**
    *   🍊 **Oranges**, 🧧 **Red Envelopes (Hongbao)**, and 🏮 **Lanterns**.
    *   Collecting these increases your **Score** and fills your **Fortune Meter**.

2.  **Avoid Bad Items:**
    *   👻 **Ghosts** and 🪨 **Stones**.
    *   Hitting these will make the Lion "Bonk" (get dizzy) and lose all collected Fortune.
    *   **Warning:** If you have **0 Fortune** and hit an obstacle, it's Game Over!

3.  **Lucky Burst (Invincibility):**
    *   Fill your Fortune Meter completely to trigger **Lucky Burst**!
    *   During this time, you are **invincible**, move faster, and sparkle with rainbow colors.
    *   Smash through obstacles without penalty!
